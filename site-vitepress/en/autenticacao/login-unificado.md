# Single login page (`/login`), optional

By default each panel has its own door — `/admin/login`, `/infra/login` and `/app/login` —, which
is Filament's behavior. With the switch on, all three lead to **`/login`**, a single login screen
(same artwork, same anti-robot protection, same social login buttons), and the kit decides where the
person goes **after** signing in.

## How to turn it on

Two ways, same key:

```dotenv
KIT_LOGIN_UNIFICADO=true
```

or, in `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → **Login** tab → "Unificar o login em /login". The toggle
takes effect immediately, no deploy: the key is read on every request, not at boot. Only `true`
and `1` turn it on — any other value in the `.env` keeps it off.

**Once installed, the screen is in charge.** Like every login key of the kit, the `.env` only
provides the **initial** value: the Settings migration seeds `login_unificado` with whatever the
`.env` said at install time, and from then on the database value overrides the `.env` on every
boot (`ConfiguracoesDoKit::aplicarNaConfig()`). Changing `KIT_LOGIN_UNIFICADO` on an existing
installation does **not** turn anything on or off — use the toggle (or `kit:install --force`,
which recreates the database). Measured on the feature's test installations.

**Project created before v0.31.0**: `php artisan kit:update` brings the migration
`database/settings/*_add_login_unificado_to_kit_settings.php` along with the code. Run
`php artisan migrate` before opening the settings screen — without the row in the database it
breaks. The seeded value is whatever the `.env` said at that moment (`false` if the key is absent).

## What changes for whoever signs in

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| Opens `/admin/login`, `/infra/login` or `/app/login` | is taken to `/login` |
| Signs in and can access **one** panel | goes straight into it — or to the URL requested before login, if it belongs to that panel |
| Signs in and can access **more than one** | `/login/painel`: a screen with one card per accessible panel (the same cards as the welcome page) |
| Signs in and can access **none** | refused, as today ("invalid credentials"; inactive or deleted accounts get the usual explanation) |
| Is already signed in and opens `/login` | goes where they would go after signing in |

The rule "may this person enter this panel?" is the usual one — `User::canAccessPanel()` —, except
the single page asks about **any** panel instead of the current one. An `admin` with no role in
`/app` signs in through `/login` and lands in `/admin`.

The intended URL (you opened `/admin/users` without a session) only wins when it belongs to a
panel you can access, on the same host. Otherwise it is discarded and the rule above applies.

The same rule applies after **registration**, not only after login. A freshly created account is
never delivered to the address of a panel it cannot access — the real case is mundane: someone
opens `/admin`, is sent to the login screen, and only then clicks the invitation link they got.
Without this check the registration worked and the first screen of the system was a permission
error. With the switch **off** the check still applies: the inaccessible address is discarded and
the panel's default destination wins.

## A panel added after installation

The choice screen lists **one card per registered panel** — the same ones the Panel Switch shows
inside Filament, with the same label and the same icon. If your application registers a new
`PanelProvider` after installation, it shows up on its own, with no kit file to edit; the default
label is the capitalized id and the icon is the generic one, exactly as the Panel Switch would do
it. To give it a name and an icon of its own, add the line to the maps in `App\Support\Paineis` —
the same ones that feed the Panel Switch, so the two never drift apart.

Only the panels the person can access show up: the filter is the same `canAccessPanel()` as always.

## The other screens without a panel prefix

With the switch on, besides `/login`:

| Screen | Address | The panel route |
|---|---|---|
| Registration (invitation and open sign-up) | `/cadastro` | `/{panel}/register` redirects there, query intact |
| Forgot my password | `/esqueci-minha-senha` | `/{panel}/password-reset/request` redirects there |

The invitation's `?token=` and the organization's `?org=` survive the redirect — an old invitation
link keeps working. Turn the switch off and both go back to the panel routes, with nothing to
migrate.

**Sign-up with multi-organization**: the "Sign up" link on the login screen only shows when there
is a destination organization, and it carries the `?org=`. Publish `/login?org={slug}` (or
`/cadastro?org={slug}`) and turn on "Accepts public sign-up" on the organization's screen — without
that the sign-up refuses, and the link disappears instead of leading to the refusal. See
[Open registration](registro-aberto.md).

## What stays per panel

- **Password redefinition (the e-mail link) and e-mail verification**: they stay inside the panels.
  Both arrive through a signed link or already authenticated, so there is nothing to unify. The
  e-mail link opens in the person's **own** panel — someone who only has `/admin` gets an
  `/admin/...` link and signs in through it.
- **2FA (Breezy)**: happens **inside** the chosen panel, as today. The choice
  screen shows up before the second-factor challenge — it only lists panels; entering one triggers
  the challenge as usual.
- **Social login**: with the switch on, the button on the single page carries no panel of origin
  (the provider must be enabled, on any panel), and the destination follows the same rule as the
  table above **restricted to the panels the provider is allowed in** — GitHub enabled only for
  `/infra` never drops anyone into `/admin`; with no allowed accessible panel, the session is
  ended. With the switch off, everything as in [Social login](login-social.md).

## The access log records the panel the person entered

The `authentication_log` stamps the panel of every access (it feeds "accesses per panel" in the
organization insights and the daily logins stat). The single page runs in the default panel's
context only for theme and layout — that does **not** go to the log: a login that starts at
`/login` is born without a panel and receives the panel it **entered** — the only accessible one,
the one of the intended URL, or the card clicked on the choice screen. While the person is on the
choice screen, the access has no panel; if they close the tab without choosing, it stays that way
(a login that entered no panel).

## Heads-up: external SSO is not pre-configured yet

The single page covers the kit's password login and social login (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, X). An
**external SSO** — SAML, corporate OpenID Connect, Keycloak, Entra ID — that authenticates the
person outside Filament and hands them back with a live session does **not** go through `/login`
nor through the destination rule: they would land on the default panel and, without access to it,
see a 403. If you integrate an SSO yourself, make its callback redirect to the same decider the
single page uses (the after-login destination class, documented in
`wikis/specs/feat/login-unificado/`) instead of to a fixed panel URL. Pre-configured external SSOs
are a planned kit item.

## If you want to go back

Turn the toggle off. Nothing was migrated or stored beyond the Settings property; the `/login`,
`/login/painel`, `/cadastro` and `/esqueci-minha-senha` routes keep existing — when off, each one
redirects to the equivalent route of the default panel.
