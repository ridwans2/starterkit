A ready-to-use **Laravel 13 + Filament 5** starter kit. One command creates the project, installs everything, migrates, seeds the database and hands you three working panels: **business**, **administration** and **infrastructure**.

```bash
composer create-project ridwans2/filament-starterkit my-project \
  --repository='{"type":"vcs","url":"https://github.com/ridwans2/starterkit.git"}'
cd my-project
composer dev
```

The `--repository` flag is required: this kit is distributed straight from GitHub, not from Packagist.

There is no manual step: `create-project` already creates the `.env`, generates the `APP_KEY`, creates the database, runs the migrations, seeds roles/permissions/user, publishes the Filament assets and builds the front-end. At the end it prints the URLs and the initial login.

Before touching the database, it **asks five questions** — the same way `laravel new` does:

| | Question | Default |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project name | the folder name |
| 2 | Database | SQLite · **PostgreSQL** (recommended: the only one with `pgvector`, required by the local AI features) · MySQL |
| 3 | Administrator e-mail and password | `admin@example.com` / `password` |
| 4 | Primary color of the panels | the Filament default |
| 5 | Multi-tenancy | off |

**Hitting Enter on everything installs exactly as before** — no question is mandatory, and the first one is "customize now?", which skips them all at once. With no terminal (CI, Docker, `--no-interaction`) nothing is asked. At the end the installer prints a summary of what changed, what is still edited by hand, and offers to run the kit's test suite.

> **On Windows the questions don't show up, and that is not a kit bug.** Measured in both shells,
> PowerShell and Git Bash: Composer never enables TTY on Windows — `ProcessExecutor::runProcess()`
> drops TTY mode when `Platform::isWindows()`, because `symfony/process` would throw
> `TTY mode is not supported on Windows platform`. `artisan` receives pipes, and the installer skips
> itself through its own terminal guard, saying so on screen.
>
> **What to do**, and the order matters:
>
> ```bash
> php artisan kit:install --force    # the five questions — RECREATES the database
> ```
>
> Run it **right after installing**, while the database holds nothing but seed data: there the
> `--force` is harmless. Later on it is destructive, because it deletes the SQLite file before asking.
>
> If the database already has data and you only want the name and the colour:
>
> ```bash
> php artisan kit:install --custom   # name and colour, touching nothing else
> ```
>
> The other three questions have no non-destructive version, and the command explains why: database
> and multi-tenancy require recreating (the permission tables only get the tenant column before
> `migrate`), and the administrator credentials **are not synced by the seeder** — it guarantees that
> an administrator exists, not that it mirrors `.env`, because it runs on every `db:seed` and
> overwriting there would revert a password changed by hand.
>
> To change the administrator's e-mail or password, the path is deliberate:
>
> ```bash
> php artisan kit:admin
> php artisan kit:admin --email=new@example.com --senha=secret --force   # no prompts — avoid it: the password lands in the shell history
> ```
>
> It asks for confirmation, never echoes the password, refuses an e-mail that already belongs to
> another account and **stops** if there is more than one `master_global` — instead of picking one by
> ordering. The panel's profile screen works too.
>
> On Linux, macOS and WSL the questions show up during `create-project` and none of this is needed.

> Multi-tenancy is the item that pays off most to decide now: switched on during installation it costs nothing; switched on later, `kit:tenancy` **recreates the database** (the permission tables only get the tenant column if the flag is active before the migration).

![Installing starter-kit-easy in a single command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/install.gif)

Prefer to clone? The same installer runs on its own:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy.git my-project
cd my-project && rm -rf .git && git init   # drop the kit's history
composer setup
```

## Demo access

The seeder creates a master user that already gets into all three panels:

| | |
|---|---|
| **User** | `admin@example.com` |
| **Password** | `password` |
| **Role** | `master_global` (beats any permission through `Gate::before`) |

Sign in at `/app`, `/admin` or `/infra` — the same session works for all three, and the user menu switches panels.

> ⚠️ **Change the password before exposing the environment.** To be born with different credentials, set `KIT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `KIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `KIT_ADMIN_NAME` in `.env` **before** running the installation (the values live in `config/kit.php`). On an already-installed project, change it from the panel itself at `/admin/users` or under **My profile**.

To see the access boundary in action, create a user with only the `admin` or `infra` role: they get into the matching panel and take a 403 on the other.

## The three panels

| Panel | URL | What for | Who gets in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **App** | `/app` | The business operation. **Intentionally empty** — this is where your project is born | `master_global`, `panel_user`, `admin_app` (with tenancy) |
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Users, roles and permissions (Shield), AI agent catalog, onboarding authoring | `master_global`, `admin` |
| **Infra** | `/infra` | Health checks, backups, queues, logs, exceptions, mail trail, recycle bin, auditing, caches, commands, Pulse, AI costs | `master_global`, `infra` |

**Who gets in comes from the role, not from a list in the code.** Each role declares which panel it is good for, in the `roles.painel` column — the **Painel** field on the `/admin` → Roles screen. `App\Models\User::canAccessPanel()` compares that column against the panel being opened. Creating a role and picking its panel **is** the act of granting access.

Null is **not** a wildcard: a role with no panel only carries permissions and opens no panel at all. The `master_global` role gets into all three another way — it beats any gate through `Gate::before` (`App\Providers\KitServiceProvider`), with no permissions in the database, and `canAccessPanel()` lets it through before it ever looks at the column.

On panels **without** tenancy (`/admin`, `/infra`) the role must be assigned in the global context: being an `admin` inside one organization is not a credential to administer the installation. On `/app` the role counts in any organization — which one you open is decided later, by `canAccessTenant()`.

**The user-menu badge shows the role for the OPEN organization.** Someone who belongs to more than one may hold different roles in each — `panel_user` in one, `admin_app` in another — and the badge follows the organization switch. With no role in the open organization there is no badge: entering the panel does not depend on the organization (that is the paragraph above), but the display does. Nothing changes on panels without tenancy, since there is no current organization there.

> With [multi-tenancy](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/multi-tenancy.html) turned on, **App** becomes `/app/{tenant}` and shows only the selected tenant's data. Admin and Infra stay global.

Separating admin from infra is the whole point of the kit: whoever administers users doesn't need (and shouldn't) see logs, queues and operational commands, and vice versa.

### What each one looks like

| Login | Administration |
|---|---|

## Our numbers

Not a showcase: it's the inventory of everything that already exists, and of what you won't have to write.

| | `/app` | `/admin` | `/infra` | **Total** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Navigable screens** | 14 | 31 | 28 | **73** |
| Resources | 4 | 8 | 8 | **20** |
| Standalone pages | 5 | 5 | 13 | **23** |
| Widgets | 1 | 9 | 19 | **29** |
| `GET` routes | 23 | 38 | 34 | **95** |

`/app` is the smallest on purpose — it is born **empty**, because that's where your business comes in.
The other two already come complete.

> **The criterion for each row, so the numbers can be audited.** A *navigable screen* is a panel
> `GET` route **with a route name**, excluding authentication routes, JSON endpoints and redirects.
> *Standalone pages* is `$panel->getPages()`, with no exclusions. *`GET` routes* counts everything
> under the panel path, including authentication and redirects. *Widgets* is `$panel->getWidgets()` —
> **panel** widgets; the 6 resource widgets in `Tenants/Widgets/` are not included, which is why an
> `ls` returns a larger number. Measured with `kit.tenancy.enabled = false`; with tenancy on, `/app`
> routes gain the organisation prefix.
>
> Until v0.36.1 the *Navigable screens* row had no declared criterion and **was not falsifiable** —
> it sat at `12 / 28 / 27` since 2026-08-18 and survived a whole fact-check uncorrected, because
> there was no way to check it. All five rows are now locked by
> `tests/Kit/SiteDeDocumentacaoTest.php`.

## What's already there

**Front door**
- **Welcome page on the `/` route**, replacing Laravel's default welcome: one card per panel plus
  what `kit:install` customised ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/autenticacao/rota-publica.html))

**Administration and security**
- Shield (roles and permissions with a UI) on top of spatie/laravel-permission
- Breezy: user profile, avatar, 2FA and passkeys
- **Full-screen user record page** (`/admin/users/{id}` and `/app/users/{id}`): account, status, origin and dates, with the edit button on top. **Only on `/admin`** does it list the person's organizations and roles — on `/app` the omission is the feature: telling them there would tell whoever administers one organization that the account also belongs to another ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/operacao/roteiro-de-features.html))
- **Avatar drawn in here**: without a photo, Filament's default provider makes every person's browser request `ui-avatars.com` on every screen — carrying the initials in the query string and the panel's `Referer` along. `App\Support\AvatarDeIniciais` returns an inline SVG on all three panels: same looks, no external request
- Auth Designer: two-column login screen — the artwork **shows the application name**, read from `APP_NAME` on every load; to use your own image, upload it at `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao`
- **Optional open sign-up** (off by default): registration without an invitation on `/app`, with a single role, manual approval and e-mail verification — each behind its own key ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/autenticacao/registro-aberto.html))
- Lockscreen: session lock on inactivity (30 min), registered on all 3 panels — the lock screen wears the same layout as the login page (Auth Designer), not Filament's simple layout
- Impersonate, authentication log, change auditing (owen-it)
- Panel Switch: switch panels from the user menu
- **DTOs with `spatie/laravel-data`**: every structured value crossing a class boundary is a typed object, with an automated guard — credentials never go into a DTO, and API consumption/responses require one ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/dto-com-laravel-data.html))
- **Optional anti-robot protection** (off by default): reCAPTCHA v2/v3, Turnstile or hCaptcha on the login, password reset and register screens, via `ddr/filament-captcha` ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/autenticacao/protecao-anti-robo.html))
- **Single login page** (off by default): `KIT_LOGIN_UNIFICADO=true` sends `/admin/login`, `/infra/login` and `/app/login` to `/login`; whoever can access one panel goes straight in, whoever can access more than one picks from a card screen after signing in. **Heads-up**: external SSO (SAML / corporate OIDC) is not pre-configured yet and does not go through that rule — see [the docs page](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/autenticacao/login-unificado.html)
- **Social login per panel**: each provider can be enabled separately for `/app`, `/admin` and `/infra`; button, route and destination respect the panel of origin

**Observability and maintenance (infra panel)**
- Spatie Health with checks for database, cache, queues, scheduler, disk (except on Windows), debug mode, environment, optimized app and local AI
- Backup Monitor (spatie/laravel-backup), Jobs Monitor, Logs Explorer (no delete button — a trail is evidence)
- **Grouped exceptions** by type and frequency — what Health, Pulse and the log file don't answer
- **Sent-mail trail**: separates "it was never sent" from "it was sent and landed in spam"
- **Recycle bin**: restores what was deleted with `SoftDeletes` ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/trilhas-de-infraestrutura.html))
- Command Center: Artisan commands pre-approved for the UI, with history
- Laravel Pulse embedded as a panel page
- Dependency Graph: a map of models, relations, resources and panels
- Release Notifier: warns you when there's a new version of the Composer packages

**AI (optional, local by default)**
- `laravel/ai` with an agent catalog in the database: system prompt, provider, model, tools and guardrails are **data**, editable in `/admin` with no deploy
- Chained guardrails: budget, prompt injection, local classifier, PII redaction and sensitive-output filter
- Execution ledger (`ai_runs`) with cost and tokens in the infra panel
- Chat widget with streaming
- 100% local inference through llama.cpp (`docker compose --profile ai up -d`) or any SaaS provider by switching `AI_PROVIDER`

**Productivity**
- **⌘K search** in place of the topbar's native field: finds records, screens, pages and creation actions — all scoped by permission (details below)
- Animated count badges in the menu, notification center with tabs, environment indicator
- **Dashboards already filled in** on the admin and infra panels: 29 widgets (stat cards with an animated counter, funnels, goals, breakdowns, timelines) over the data the panels already have — including today's logins with a seven-day history and, with tenancy, organization insights and accesses
- Branded error pages (Sentinel) in Portuguese (pt-BR) — the 403 one only shows the permission diagnosis outside production
- 100% pt-BR UI, including plugins that ship English only (translations in `lang/vendor/`)
- **Language switcher** on all three panels and on the login screens — driven by data, not by a flag (details below)
- **Media layer** (spatie/laravel-medialibrary) inside Filament's components: uploads, collections and conversions in form, table and infolist ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/anexos-e-midia.html))
- **Rich header** on top of the view and edit screens for users and organizations: avatar (or the initials), name, status badge and copyable metadata, in place of Filament's plain text title
- **Unsaved-changes warning** when leaving a form on any of the three panels, and **your system's version in the footer** — both are a switch at `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao`, no deploy ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/configuracoes-do-kit.html))
- **Layout density in three steps**, on the same settings screen: *confortável* (Filament's own default), *compacto* and *denso*. It tightens the stat cards, the tables, the sidebar and the buttons of all three panels at once, and **takes effect on the next refresh** — no Vite theme, no `npm run build`, no deploy. Measured on the kit itself: the table row drops **−17.1%** on compacto and **−23.4%** on denso ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/configuracoes-do-kit.html#densidade-do-layout))
- **Direct link to each organization's panel** (with multi-tenancy) on all three `/admin` screens — list, view and edit. On the list it is a column with the address in plain sight, opening in a new tab: you know where it goes before clicking ([details](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/multi-tenancy.html))

### Layout density, on the same screen

| Confortável (default) | Compacto | Denso |
|---|---|---|
| [![Comfortable density](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/thumbs/densidade-confortavel.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/densidade-confortavel.png) | [![Compact density](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/thumbs/densidade-compacto.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/densidade-compacto.png) | [![Dense density](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/thumbs/densidade-denso.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsferro/filament-starter-kit-easy/main/art/densidade-denso.png) |

Look at the actions column: on *confortável* it is clipped to *"Edi…"*; on *denso* it fits whole.
Tightening is not only about height — it stops hiding content.

### Future improvements

The **[kit roadmap](wikis/roadmap.md)** records what has already been looked at and **deliberately
deferred**, with the reason and, where there was one, the measurement behind the decision: per-user
appearance preferences, Filament's paid compact theme, and the trigger that retires the current
density implementation.

It ships with your project on purpose — it is the **kit's** future, not your project's, and it
exists so you don't spend an afternoon re-evaluating something that already has numbers on record.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+ and Composer 2
- Node 20+ (optional — without it the installation still goes through and tells you how to build later)
- Docker (optional — only for Postgres/MySQL, Redis, local AI and e-mail)

## Database

**The installation asks** — SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL. The default is **SQLite**, so it depends on nothing.

**PostgreSQL is the recommended one**, for a functional reason: it is the only one shipping `pgvector`, which the local AI features that use semantic search (embeddings) depend on. With SQLite or MySQL the rest of the kit runs the same — only those features are unavailable.

**Postgres and MySQL both ship a container** — MySQL in its own profile, because the installation picks a single database. The commands are in the [Docker](#docker) section.

If you pick Postgres during installation, the `.env` already comes with the block `docker-compose.yml` reads. If the container is not up at that moment, the kit warns you, **skips the migrations** and prints the command to finish:

```bash
docker compose up -d              # pgsql (with pgvector) + redis
php artisan migrate --seed
```

To switch after the installation, bring the containers up and copy the variables:

```bash
docker compose up -d              # pgsql (with pgvector) + redis
# copy the database block from .env.docker into your .env
php artisan migrate --seed
```

## Docker

Everything is opt-in per profile. One container per feature:

```bash
docker compose up -d                            # pgsql (with pgvector) + redis
docker compose up -d mysql redis                # MySQL instead of Postgres
docker compose --profile ai up -d               # + llama.cpp (chat and embeddings)
docker compose --profile mail up -d             # + mailpit (1025 / 8025)
docker compose --profile full up -d             # the whole infrastructure
docker compose --profile app up -d --build      # the containerized application
docker compose --profile realtime up -d reverb pulse
```

| Service | Port | Profile |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector | 5432 | base |
| MySQL 8 | 3306 | `mysql` |
| Redis 7 (cache only) | 6379 | base |
| llama.cpp (chat) | 8080 | `ai` |
| llama.cpp (embeddings) | 8081 | `ai` |
| Mailpit | 1025 / 8025 | `mail` |
| App (nginx + php-fpm) | 8000 | `app` |
| Reverb (WebSocket) | 8090 | `app`, `realtime` |

Reverb uses 8090 instead of the default 8080 so it doesn't collide with llama.cpp.

No service declares a fixed `container_name`: the prefix comes from `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, which `kit:install` writes with your project's name. [Details on the site](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/comecar/instalacao-avancada.html).

### A local hostname, instead of IP and port

You can open the project at `http://my-project.test` rather than `http://127.0.0.1:8000`: it costs one line in the machine's `hosts` file and two keys in `.env`. No versioned file changes, adoption is individual, and anyone who does nothing stays on `http://localhost:8000`. [Full recipe, including the Windows elevation trap](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/comecar/dominio-local.html).

**`kit:install` offers to do this at the end of the installation**: it suggests the domain from the name you chose, writes the line into `hosts` (asking for elevation on Windows) and adjusts `APP_URL`. It is opt-in, depends on no flag, and declining leaves everything exactly as it always was. A domain outside the suffixes reserved for local use (`.test`, `.localhost`, `.example`, `.invalid`) takes one more yes, because pointing a real domain at `127.0.0.1` blocks access to the actual site on this machine.

### Updating the stack on the machine that hosts it

`./deploy_docker_local.sh` runs **on the container host** (not on your development machine) and does the whole sequence: `git pull`, image rebuild, `--profile app up -d`, migrations, `optimize:clear`, a health check on `/up` and a TCP probe of Reverb. Output is appended to `storage/logs/deploy_docker_local.log`.

```bash
./deploy_docker_local.sh
./deploy_docker_local.sh --recreate   # when .env changed
```

The rebuild comes **after** the pull because the image is self-contained (the code is baked into it) — rebuilding first would bake the old code. And since it recreates `reverb` and `pulse`, both in the same `app` profile, there is no separate restart command: a long-running process won't see new code without restarting.

`--recreate` adds `--force-recreate`, needed when `.env` changed: Compose reads `env_file` when the container is **created**, so an existing container keeps the old values. If `.env.example` changed in the pull, the script warns you.

## Commands

```bash
composer dev          # server + queue + vite together

## Customize your project

**The installer already asks the first five** — the list below is for changing them later, or for whoever skipped the questions.

| # | What | Where | Asked during installation? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Name** | `APP_NAME` in `.env` | ✅ |
| 2 | **Database** | the `DB_*` block in `.env` | ✅ |
| 3 | **Seeder credentials** | `KIT_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `KIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` | ✅ |
| 4 | **Primary color** | `KIT_COR_PRIMARIA` in `.env` (a color name from the Filament palette), or `KIT_COR_PRIMARIA_HEX` with a free hex value — the hex beats the name when both are filled | ✅ |
| 5 | **[Multi-tenancy](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/multi-tenancy.html)** | `php artisan kit:tenancy`, and the displayed term in `config/kit.php` → `tenancy.label` | ✅ |
| 6 | **Login artwork** | none: it **shows the application name** (`APP_NAME`) on its own. To replace it with your own image, upload it at `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` | ✅ (via the name) |
| 7 | **Panel access** | each user's role (`/admin` → Roles, the *Painel* field); the rule that reads it is `App\Models\User::canAccessPanel()` | — |
| 8 | **Permission matrix** | `database/seeders/PapeisSeeder.php` | — |
| 9 | **Health checks** | `KitServiceProvider::configureHealthChecks()` | — |
| 10 | **Commands in the UI** | `config/command-center.php` | — |
| 11 | **Backups** | destination and schedule in `config/backup.php` | — |
| 12 | **AI agent** | `/admin` → AI Agents (or `database/seeders/AssistenteSeeder.php`) | — |
| 13 | **[Panel languages](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/referencia/busca-e-idioma.html)** | `config/kit.php` → `idiomas` (a list of locales; with only one, the switcher doesn't show) | — |
| 14 | **[Trail retention](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/trilhas-de-infraestrutura.html)** | `KIT_RETENCAO_EXCECOES_DIAS` / `KIT_RETENCAO_EMAILS_DIAS` in `.env` | — |
| 15 | **[Media disk](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/anexos-e-midia.html)** | `MEDIA_DISK` in `.env` (`local` by default — private, served through a signed URL) | `php artisan kit:midia-privada` migrates media already written to a public disk |
| 16 | **[CSV import and export](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/import-export-csv.html)** | the Action in each `app/Filament/**/Pages/List*.php` (on or commented out); the permission in `config/filament-shield.php` → `policies.methods`; history retention in `KIT_RETENCAO_IMPORTACOES_DIAS` / `KIT_RETENCAO_EXPORTACOES_DIAS` in `.env` | reseed `ShieldPermissionsSeeder` + `PapeisSeeder` after touching the config |

The last eleven are not asked because they are **code or screen data**, not a value that fits in a terminal prompt. The installer lists them in the final summary, each with its file.

> ⚠️ Item 5 is the only one that is **not** "edit a file" once installed: `kit:tenancy` runs `migrate:fresh --seed` and **deletes your data**. It requires a clean git tree and an explicit confirmation. **Answered during installation it deletes nothing** — the database does not exist yet, and that is the right moment to decide.

> The primary color applies to all three panels. With [multi-tenancy](https://gsferro.github.io/filament-starter-kit-easy/en/recursos/multi-tenancy.html) on, each organization's color **wins** over it inside `/app/{slug}` — `/admin` and `/infra` keep the project's one. For a full palette, and not just `primary`, the way is still `->colors([...])` in each `app/Providers/Filament/*PanelProvider.php`.

## Updating a project born from the kit

**The kit is a starting point, not a dependency.** After `create-project` the project is yours: you rename panels, change `canAccessPanel()`, edit seeders. That's why there is **no** `kit:update` that overwrites files — it would rewrite exactly what you customized, and a starter kit that ruins the user's project is worth nothing.

What changes splits into three layers, and each one has its own path:

| Layer | What it is | How to update |
|---|---|---|
| **Dependencies** | Filament, plugins, Laravel | `composer update` — it's most of the improvements and it arrives on its own |
| **The kit's glue** | providers, traits, widgets, error views | manual diff against the new tag (below) |
| **Your business** | everything you wrote | never touched |

## Troubleshooting

- **403 on every panel, right after signing in** — the user has no role at all, or their role has no panel declared (an empty `roles.painel` is not a wildcard: it opens nothing). Give them a role at `/admin` → Users, or fill in the *Painel* field at `/admin` → Roles.
- **`/infra` or `/admin` returning 403** — your user needs a role whose panel is that one (`master_global`, `admin` or `infra`), and with multi-tenancy on the role must be assigned in the global context. The 403 screen shows which permission was missing, but **only outside production**: in production it reveals neither roles nor permissions.
- **Filament assets gone** — `php artisan filament:assets`.
- **Pulse with no data** — the daemon is missing: `php artisan pulse:check` (or the compose `pulse` service).
- **The bell doesn't update in real time** — `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` requires the Reverb process to be up; without it the kit falls back to 30s polling.
- **AI assistant unavailable** — bring up `docker compose --profile ai up -d` (the first boot downloads ~4.5 GB of model) or switch `AI_PROVIDER` to a SaaS provider with an API key.
