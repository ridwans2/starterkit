> **Engines under the plugins**, installed as dependencies (you don't declare them, but they're what actually runs): `spatie/laravel-permission` (Shield), `spatie/laravel-health` (the checks), `spatie/laravel-activitylog` (the activity log), `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` (the attachments) and `livewire/livewire` (all of Filament).

## Model Caching

The kit applies the `App\Traits\ModeloCacheavel` trait to models that have a Resource on the `/app` panel — currently `User`, `Convite` and `Projeto`. The `mike-bronner/laravel-model-caching` package caches Eloquent queries when `MODEL_CACHE_ENABLED=true`.

- The default is `false` (`MODEL_CACHE_ENABLED=false` in `.env.example`).
- To turn it on, set `MODEL_CACHE_ENABLED=true` and use `MODEL_CACHE_STORE=model-cache` (Redis store configured in `config/cache.php`).
- Invalidation is automatic: `save`, `update` and `delete` clear the model's cache.
- The `/admin` and `/infra` panels remain **without** model caching by default, reducing the risk of stale data on administrative screens.

```bash
php artisan modelCache:clear      # clears the model cache
```
