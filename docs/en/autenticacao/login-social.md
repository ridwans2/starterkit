A second way in, next to the password: the **Sign in with…** buttons below the login form on all
three panels. Each provider ships **turned off**, is turned on **individually**, and once on does
exactly one thing — authenticate someone who **already has an account**.

| Provider | Socialite driver | Redirect URI | How the kit confirms the e-mail is verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google** | `google` | `/auth/google/callback` | `email_verified` field in the payload |
| **GitHub** | `github` | `/auth/github/callback` | Socialite already hands over only the `primary` + `verified` address, or nothing — presence is the proof |
| **LinkedIn** | `linkedin-openid` | `/auth/linkedin-openid/callback` | `email_verified` from the OpenID userinfo |
| **X** (formerly Twitter) | `x` | `/auth/x/callback` | X only ever returns `confirmed_email` — presence is the proof |

**Facebook and Discord were left out**, and not by oversight. See
[Facebook and Discord: why they are not here](#facebook-and-discord-why-they-are-not-here) for what
it would take to include them.

## What social login does, and what it deliberately does not

True for all **four** providers, without exception:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Authenticates** an existing account matching the e-mail the provider returns | ✅ always, when enabled |
| **Creates** an account for someone who has none | ❌ only with open registration on, which ships off |
| Accepts an **unverified** e-mail from the provider | ❌ never — it refuses and records the reason |
| Bypasses **two-factor** | ❌ never — a confirmed-2FA account still hits the challenge |
| Stores the access token or `refresh_token` | ❌ nothing is stored |
| Stores the **identity** at the provider (`sub`) | ✅ in `vinculos_sociais` — that is how the account is recognised from the second time on ([details](#linking-to-the-provider-the-first-time-and-the-next-ones)) |
| Adds a new column to `users` | ✅ **one**, `origem` — it only says which door the account came through (`google`, `github`, `convite`, `registro`, `interno`), shown on the users list and the dashboard. **Not a link**: no provider id, no token; the link is still the verified e-mail |
| Marks a created account as **e-mail verified** | ✅ yes — the provider already proved it, and asking again would be the same proof twice |

The second row is the important one, and it is not timidity: **the invitation is the kit's only
front door**. The callback example in the Laravel Socialite documentation is
`User::updateOrCreate()` — copied here, it would turn anyone with an account on **any** of the
providers into a user of your system, bypassing the invitation, the verification and the role
assignment. That is an authorization hole, not a convenience. If you **do** want sign-up through
social login, turn open registration on: the kit then creates the account and takes the person to
their own profile screen to fill in what is missing.

And remember the rest of the kit: **an account with no role opens no panel**
(`User::canAccessPanel()`). Someone arriving through social login needs a role like everybody else —
the account created by open registration gets its single role, through the same door as the form.

**The account the provider creates has no password the person knows** (it is born with a random
one), and three things ask for the current password: changing it, turning on 2FA and unlocking the
session. That is why the profile (`/app/meu-perfil`, and the other two panels') has the **Set a
password by e-mail** block: it sends the same link as "Forgot your password?", ends the session —
the page that sets the password only opens for someone logged out — and, once the password is set,
all three work. Measured on a real install: it was the first stumble for whoever came in through
Google.

## Turning a provider on, in four steps

The steps are the same for all four; only the place where you create the OAuth app changes. You can
do everything through `.env` **or** through `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → the **Login** tab — but
know who is in charge: **the database wins over `.env` at runtime, and `.env` only seeds it** (see
[Who wins: the database or `.env`?](../../recursos/configuracoes-do-kit/#who-wins-the-database-or-env)). Step 3 is where that matters.

**1. Create the OAuth app at the provider** and register the redirect URI — your `APP_URL` plus the
path from the table above:

| Provider | Where to create it | What to ask for there |
|---|---|---|
| **Google** | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → *APIs & Services* → *Credentials* → *OAuth client ID*, type **Web application** | nothing beyond the defaults |
| **GitHub** | [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) → *OAuth Apps* → *New OAuth App* | nothing to tick; the kit requests the `user:email` scope in code, and that scope is what makes verification confirmable |
| **LinkedIn** | [linkedin.com/developers](https://www.linkedin.com/developers) → *Create app* → *Products* tab | **enable the _Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect_ product**. Without it the provider does not return `email_verified`, and the kit refuses every login |
| **X** | [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) → *Projects & Apps* → *User authentication settings* | type **Web App**, **OAuth 2.0**, and the `users.read` and `users.email` scopes |

An example URI to register:

```text
https://your-domain.com/auth/github/callback
http://localhost:8000/auth/github/callback     # for development
```

That path is not a choice: it lives in `config/services.php` as a **relative** path, on purpose, so
it follows the `APP_URL` of each environment without one more variable to forget.

**2. Write the provider's three keys into `.env`:**

```dotenv
# Google
KIT_SOCIALITE_GOOGLE=true
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-your-secret

# GitHub
KIT_SOCIALITE_GITHUB=true
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.abc123
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret

# LinkedIn (linkedin-openid driver)
KIT_SOCIALITE_LINKEDIN=true
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=86abc123
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret

# X (formerly Twitter)
KIT_SOCIALITE_X=true
X_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
X_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
```

**3. Get the keys into the database.** On a **fresh** install `migrate` does it by itself — the
settings migration seeds every property from `config()`, which comes from `.env`. On a kit that is
**already installed**, `.env` alone turns **nothing** on, and `config:clear` does not change that:
the `settings` table already has the row (`false`, empty credential) and it wins on every request.
Two ways out: save through `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → **Login**, or run
`php artisan kit:install --force` with `.env` already filled in — which **recreates the database**
(DELETES the data; harmless only in the minute after installing). Measured on a real install: the
three Google keys in `.env`, `config:clear`, and no button — until the migration re-read `.env`.

**4. Confirm the button showed up.** If it did not, it is one of the two conditions below.

> **Through the screen instead of `.env`**: `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → **Login** has one
> section per provider. Turning the switch on **opens** the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields
> for that provider — and only that one. The *Client Secret* is stored **encrypted**, is never
> displayed back and does not appear in the page source; leaving the field blank **keeps** whatever
> was already stored.

## Linking to the provider: the first time, and the next ones

The question that motivated this section: *"could I create a Google account with someone else's
e-mail and get into their account?"* **No** — and it is worth understanding why before reading
what the kit does on top of that.

The kit only accepts an e-mail the provider declares **verified** (table above). Google, GitHub,
LinkedIn and X only mark an e-mail as verified after sending a code or a link **to that mailbox**.
So whoever gets a "verified" identity with somebody else's e-mail already controls that person's
mailbox — and whoever controls the mailbox already gets in through the kit's own **"Forgot your
password?"**. Social login does not open a door that did not exist: it accepts the same proof. It
is the model Auth0 calls *trusted providers*.

Two residual risks remain, and they are what the link addresses: a **recycled address** at the
e-mail provider (the new owner verifies the address at Google and would reach the previous owner's
account — but would also reset that password), and a **bug or compromise of the OAuth provider**.

**The link.** Every social login stores, in the `vinculos_sociais` table, the person's identity
**at the provider** — the `sub`, the account id over there, stable even when the e-mail changes —
next to the kit account. No token: it is recognition, not a credential. From the second login on
the account is recognised **by the link, before looking at the e-mail**: an e-mail change at the
provider, or a recycled address, does not lead to another account.

**The first time.** When a provider shows up for the first time on an account that **already
existed**, what happens depends on a switch — `KIT_SOCIALITE_VINCULO_CONFIRMAR` in `.env`, or the
`/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → **Login** → "Require e-mail confirmation…" screen:

| | Default mode (`false`) | Strict mode (`true`) |
|---|---|---|
| Account exists, first time for this provider | links, **logs in**, and sends the e-mail *"your account was accessed through Google for the first time — wasn't you? change your password and tell the administrator"* | **does not log in**; sends the e-mail *"confirm signing in through Google"* with a signed **30-minute** link; opening it creates the link and starts the session |
| Account exists, already linked | logs in through the link, no e-mail | same |
| Account does not exist, open registration on | creates through the open-registration door and is born linked — there is no previous account to protect | same |
| Account does not exist, registration closed | refuses ("access is by invitation") | same |

The default-mode e-mail is **detection**: it makes the residual risk visible to the person
themselves. Strict mode is **prevention**: it demands the proof (the mailbox) at the exact moment
it matters. The confirmation link is valid only for that account and that identity, is signed,
expires, and if the identity already belongs to **another** account the confirmation refuses — a
provider identity belongs to one account only.

> Both e-mails go through the **queue** (`ShouldQueue`, like the invitation). Without a worker
> running nothing goes out — `composer dev` starts one. On the real-install validation that was the
> first stumble: the "link sent" notice showed up, and the e-mail sat in the `jobs` table until
> `queue:work`.

**Signing up through the provider, from the registration screen.** `/app/register` shows the same
buttons (with open registration on), and the click carries the screen's context until OAuth comes
back: with multi-tenancy, `/app/register?org=acme` creates the account **in `acme`**, with the
open-registration role there — the same door as the form, with the same refusals (unknown or closed
organisation). From an **invitation link** (`?token=`), signing in through the provider **accepts the
invitation**: the account is born with (or the existing one gains) the invitation's organisation and
role, and the invitation is consumed — as long as the provider's verified e-mail is the invited one;
if it is another, it refuses and the invitation stays intact. No password in any case: the provider
proved the e-mail. A new account **without** `?org=` under multi-tenancy is still refused.

An **existing** account logs in normally in any mode, but **does not consume an invitation** through
this path: `?token=` travels on a public GET route with no CSRF, and with the provider's silent SSO
the acceptance would happen without the person clicking anything. Someone who already has an account
accepts the invitation on the authenticated **Invitations received** screen, which requires the owner
and asks for confirmation. Audit and decision in

Decisions and cases: `wikis/specs/feat/vinculo-de-provedor-social/`.

## Each provider chooses its panels

On `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` → **Login**, each provider's **Allowed panels** field separately
controls where its button and routes are available: `/app`, `/admin` and `/infra`. An empty list
means all panels, preserving the behavior of existing installations.

The barrier is enforced by the server, not only by the interface. Manually changing the URL to
start or finish OAuth through a disallowed panel returns **404**. The panel of origin is kept in the
session during the round trip to the provider, including when `/app` uses multi-tenancy.

## The destination respects the panel of origin

Someone who starts social login at `/admin/login` returns to `/admin`; from `/infra/login` they
return to `/infra`; and from `/app/login` they return to `/app` — or to the correct organization
when multi-tenancy is enabled. A refusal also returns to the login screen of origin.

Authentication does not bypass authorization: after the callback, `User::canAccessPanel()` remains
the final barrier. Enabling a provider on a panel does not grant access to that panel.

## The button only shows with EVERYTHING filled in — per provider

There are **three** conditions, in conjunction, and they fail for different reasons:

- that provider's switch on — off is a choice made by whoever installed;
- the current panel (`app`, `admin` or `infra`) allowed for that provider — an empty list means all panels, preserving existing installations;
- its `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect` **all filled in** — an empty credential is an
  oversight by whoever configured.

A switch on with an empty `client_secret` keeps the button off the air, on purpose: a button leading
to a non-existent OAuth is a promise the screen cannot keep.

**And turning it off takes the ROUTE down, not just the button.** With a provider unavailable,
`/auth/{provider}/redirect` and `/auth/{provider}/callback` answer **404** — only that provider's,
the others stay up. Hiding the button would be no barrier at all: the URL is fixed, public and
well known.

**A provider outside the list answers 404 without even reaching the controller.**
`/auth/facebook/callback`, `/auth/discord/callback` or any other segment return 404 because the
route parameter is typed as `App\Support\ProvedorSocial` — the allow-list *is* the enum, and the
router consults it.

Each switch also **fails closed**: `false`, `0`, `off`, `no`, empty and any unrecognizable value
keep it off. Only `true` and `1` turn it on.

## The login screen footer

The same configuration brings a Markdown footer (bold, italic, link; raw HTML is discarded) to the bottom of the login screen on all three panels:

```dotenv
KIT_LOGIN_RODAPE="Acme · All rights reserved"
```

Empty (or whitespace only) = no footer, no empty strip.

It is **text, not HTML**, and the value is escaped on output. The login screen is public and
unauthenticated: raw HTML coming from an editable field there would be stored XSS with the worst
possible reach — the screen everyone comes through. If you need a link in the footer, the answer is
a structured field (text + URL, validated), not a free-form HTML field.

## Unverified e-mail: why we refuse, and how each provider proves it

The link to the kit account is made **by e-mail**, compared case-insensitively and trimmed. That is
simple and costs no new column — but it carries a known risk: if the provider returned an
**unverified** e-mail, creating an account at that provider with somebody else's address would be
enough to get into their account. With the kit's registration closed — the default — that is
precisely the main path, not an edge case.

So the kit **requires positive proof** from every provider. Absent, false, or anything that is not
clearly true ⇒ **refusal**, with a notice on screen and the `email_nao_verificado` reason in the
log. Fails closed, always.

What changes from provider to provider is **where** the proof lives, and the difference is large:

- **Google** — reports `email_verified` in the payload (plus a `verified_email` alias). The kit
  reads it and requires true.
- **LinkedIn** — the OpenID Connect userinfo carries `email_verified`. That is why the kit uses the
  `linkedin-openid` driver and not the legacy `linkedin`: the legacy one reports **no verification
  at all**, and its scopes were deprecated by LinkedIn itself.
- **X** — has no verification field, because it does not need one: X only ever returns
  `confirmed_email`, that is, an address it has already confirmed. **The presence of the e-mail is
  the proof.** If X returns no e-mail (an app without the `users.email` scope, or an account with no
  confirmed address), the kit refuses with the `email_ausente` reason.
- **GitHub** — presence as well, by a route worth understanding before you touch the scopes.
  Socialite queries `/user/emails`, picks the entry that is `primary` **and** `verified`, and
  **overwrites** the e-mail with it — or with **nothing**, if the query fails or no entry matches.
  There is no verification field in the payload, and none is needed: a filled e-mail already means
  `primary` + `verified`, and an empty one falls into the `email_ausente` refusal.

  This rests on **one** condition: the `user:email` scope. It is the driver's default, and the
  `scopes` key in `config/services.php` **merges** with the defaults rather than replacing them, so
  adding scopes is safe. What would break the guarantee is a `setScopes()` in the kit's code
  dropping `user:email` — GitHub would then hand over the **public profile** e-mail, unverified,
  silently. There is a test guarding exactly that; do not turn that scope off.

  > Earlier versions of this section said the kit re-ran the `/user/emails` query itself. It did,
  > and it was redundant: the reading of Socialite's code that justified the call was wrong. The
  > call was removed — the kit calls **no** provider API at all.

One consequence to know, for all of them: if the person **changes the e-mail** on the provider
account, the link is lost and they go back to signing in with a password.

## Known limitation: the destination is always the `/app` panel

**Resolved in v0.29.0:** the destination now respects the panel of origin, as described above.

## Facebook and Discord: why they are not here

The original requirement asked for both. Neither made it, each for a different reason.

**Facebook — there is no way to confirm the e-mail.** Socialite has the driver, and it works; what
does not exist is a field asserting that **that address** was confirmed. The `verified` field the
provider requests is **account** level, legacy, and absent from the Graph API version it uses; the
OIDC/Limited Login path returns claims without `email_verified`. Accepting Facebook would make the
assurance level of your login depend on **which button the person clicked** — and the weakest button
would be the vector. If you knowingly accept that risk, what is missing is: a case in
`App\Support\ProvedorSocial` whose verification branch states the assumption, the block in
`config/services.php` (key `facebook`) and in `config/kit.php`, and the three Settings properties.
**Read ADR-05 first** — it lists the alternatives that were considered and why each is worse.

**Discord — it is not a Socialite driver.** The official documentation supports Facebook, X,
LinkedIn, Google, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Slack; everything else comes from the community
catalogue at [socialiteproviders.com](https://socialiteproviders.com). Including it requires
`composer require socialiteproviders/discord` **and** registering a `SocialiteWasCalled` listener —
a new dependency and a second extension mechanism. The kit does not add dependencies on its own; if
you want it, that is the path, plus a case in the enum (Discord does expose a `verified` field in the
payload, so the barrier has something to stand on).

## Where the records go

Everything goes to the **`autenticacao`** channel (`storage/logs/autenticacao-*.log`), in the same
format as the rest of the kit — `[Class@method] message | key: value`, with the **e-mail masked**,
the `provedor` on every line and a readable `motivo` on each refusal:

| `motivo` | What happened |
|---|---|
| `falha_no_provedor` | invalid CSRF `state`, network down, or credential rejected by the provider |
| `email_ausente` | the provider returned no e-mail (on X, this is the missing-scope case) |
| `email_nao_verificado` | the e-mail is not verified at the provider |
| `conta_inexistente_registro_fechado` | there is no account and open registration is off |
| `conta_criada_por_login_social` | a new account was created (open registration on) |

No **`client_secret` ever appears** — not in a log, not on screen, not in an error message, and not
in the HTML of the configuration screen. And the messages returned to the visitor are deliberately
generic: telling which barrier refused hands reconnaissance information to anyone probing. The
reason stays in the log, for you.

Social login also lands in the `/infra` panel's **access trail** (who signed in, when, from where),
like any other login — with no configuration at all.

## The Google secret was stored in cleartext in the audit trail up to v0.19.3

**If you configured `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` through the `/admin/configuracoes-da-aplicacao` screen on any
version between 0.19.2 and 0.19.3, rotate that secret in the Google console.**

Why: the audit trail's secret mask decides what to hide by consulting the
`ConfiguracoesDoKit::encrypted()` list, and the Google `client_secret` was not on that list. So
every save through the screen wrote the value **in cleartext** into the `old_values`/`new_values`
columns of the `audits` table — and the audit screen displays those columns for reading.

What this version does for you:

- **fixes the list**, which closes the leak going forward for all four provider secrets and the
  SMTP password at once (one list, three consumers: the read decryptor, the write encryptor and
  the trail's mask);
- **masks what is already stored**, in a migration that replaces the value with the same mask the
  trail uses today. The trail row is preserved — who changed it, when and from where stays on
  record; only the value that should never have been there goes;
- **warns in the log** (`configuracoes` channel) how many rows were masked, with the instruction
  to rotate.

Masking the trail does **not** undo the fact that the value was readable. That is why the rotation
is yours, and it is the one step the kit cannot take for you.

## Adding the next provider

The kit **does** have a provider abstraction now, and it is an enum:
`App\Support\ProvedorSocial`. The decision was made with four cases in hand, not one — which
revealed that the axis worth abstracting was not the redirect nor the button (identical across all
of them), but the **e-mail verification** (radically different in each).

The recipe for a fifth provider, deliberately short:

1. a new case in the enum, with `value` = the **Socialite driver name** (that same value is the URL
   segment and the key in both config files), plus the `rotulo()`, `icone()` and
   **`emailVerificado()`** branches;
2. a block in `config/services.php` and one in `config/kit.php` → `login`, and the keys in
   `.env.example`;
3. three properties in `App\Settings\ConfiguracoesDoKit`, a line each in `mapaDeConfiguracao()`, the
   `client_secret` in **`encrypted()`**, and the `add`/`addEncrypted` pair in a new migration under
   `database/settings/`;
4. an SVG partial in `resources/views/filament/auth/icones/`.

**No logic file changes**: the routes, the controller, the buttons blade and the Login tab of the
Settings screen all iterate `ProvedorSocial::cases()`. And the exhaustive `match` in
`emailVerificado()` **demands** the new branch — forgetting it does not pass static analysis.

**If the provider does not allow confirming e-mail verification, that is an architecture decision,
not a `?? true`.** It is what took Facebook off the list. Record the choice before writing the
branch.
